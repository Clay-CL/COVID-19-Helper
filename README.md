This is an App which makes use of [COVID-19 India API](https://api.covid19india.org/) to display the Daily Increase of Corona Virus Cases in India,

Originally it was taught by Rahul Pandey Sir, (check out his youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7NYbSE8uaBB1EiPYScD66ZVWyu6cOyrR))

This app makes use of MVVM architecture and Kotlin Coroutines.
